# word-hangman
Hangman is a classic paper and pencil game, but in this case I've built a more digital version of it. The idea of the gallows may be a little morbid, so in this case instead of hanging a man from the gallows, we play until the letters of the word "hangman" are exhausted.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 (or more). 1 must be the executioner, and 1 or more letter guessers.

WHAT'S NEEDED TO PLAY: A pencil and some paper are needed to play the game, or in this case a python interpreter. 

HOW TO PLAY: Choose one person to be the executioner. That person will think of a word or short phrase an mark out blanks (short lines) for each letter of each word. Then another player will guess a letter. If that letter is in the word(s) then write the letter in everywhere it would appear, an cross out that letter in the alphabet. If the letter isn't in the word then add a body part to the gallows (or in this case cross out a letter from the word "hangman"). The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word (or phrase) or the word "hangman" is exhausted.

TO WIN: The executioner wins if "hangman" is exhausted. The guesser(s) wins if they guess the word before the word is exhausted.
